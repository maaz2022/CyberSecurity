Python Example: Simulating a Basic DoS Attack
def simulate_dos():
    target_ip = "192.168.1.1"  # Replace with a sample internal IP for demonstration
    target_port = 80
    message = b"Simulated packet payload for learning."

    print("Simulating DoS attack by sending packets (for learning purposes)...")
    for i in range(10):  # Limit the number of packets
        print(f"Packet {i + 1} -> Target: {target_ip}:{target_port} - Message: {message.decode()}")
    print("Simulation completed. No real packets were sent.")
